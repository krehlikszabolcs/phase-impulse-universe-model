## I. Introduction

The **Phase–Impulse Universe Model (PIUM)** describes the universe as a single, continuous **phase–interference wave field**.  
All physical phenomena — matter, spacetime, gravity, entanglement, dark matter, and cosmic expansion — emerge from the properties and evolution of this field.

PIUM intentionally does **not** address the metaphysical origin of the first impulse.  
The model begins when the universal phase field already exists and the **recurring impulse mechanism** that generates spacetime is active.

The foundational entity is the **phase field φ**, which oscillates, interferes with itself, and produces matter and spacetime through recurring impulse cycles.

## II. The Universe as a Phase–Interference Field

In PIUM, the universe is:

- wave-like at every point,  
- continuously propagating,  
- self-interfering,  
- structured by periodic impulses.

Matter is **not** a separate substance. It is:

> a locally observed, repeating phase-segment of the universal wave field.

A particle is the measurement-isolated appearance of a recurring phase point.  
The wave carries the information;  
the particle is the visible impulse of one phase slice.

## III. The Nullphase (φ = 0) and Dark Matter

The **nullphase** is the zero-amplitude crossing of the wave cycle:

- amplitude = 0  
- transition speed = maximal  
- energy density = high  
- detectability = zero (no amplitude deviation)

Thus the nullphase is **not** empty or passive.  
It is the **energetic equilibrium state** of the wave.

PIUM interprets **dark matter** as:

> the gravitational influence of the omnipresent nullphase state.

It is always present, always gravitationally active, but invisible to amplitude-based detection.

## IV. Particles as Phase–Impulse Systems

A particle is:

- a recurring wave phase-segment,  
- stabilized by local interference density,  
- localized only when measured.

Particle properties (mass, quantization) arise from wave periodicity.

Measurement isolates one impulse;  
the particle is the *repeated* reappearance of the deeper wave structure.

## V. Spin as Structural Phase Property

Spin is **not** rotation and not spatial.  
In PIUM, spin is:

> the structural property of the local phase-slope and transition pattern.

Determined by:

- rising or falling phase branch,  
- steepness of the phase gradient,  
- local wave frequency,  
- ordering of phase transitions.

Different spin states correspond to different structural configurations of the same wave segment.

---

## VI. Entanglement as Structural Identity

Entanglement is not communication, not nonlocal signaling.  
Two entangled particles appear correlated because:

> they share the same underlying wave-structure identity.

Changing one measurement point affects the *shared structure*,  
so the partner reflects the same configuration.

Entanglement is **structural unity**, not spatial interaction.

---

## VII. Gravity as Phase-Density Flow Toward the Nullphase

Gravity in PIUM is not a force or pull.

Gravity is:

> the natural flow of wave configurations toward regions closer to the nullphase equilibrium.

Where:

- high interference density = strong gravitational effect  
- high nullphase presence = strong gravitational pull  

Matter density corresponds to interference density; both shape the gravitational field.

---

## VIII. Black Holes as Interference–Saturation Zones

A black hole is:

> a region where the phase field becomes hyper-saturated with interference  
> and phase, antiphase, and nullphase coexist in unstable overlap.

### Key characteristics:

1. **Entering waves become structurally unstable.**  
   Phase gradients steepen dramatically.

2. **Nullphase transitions become extremely frequent.**  
   This produces the overwhelming gravitational field.

3. **At the event horizon, extreme amplitude maxima appear.**  
   These are phase spikes detected as discrete impulse-like events.

4. **The interior contains chaotic, over-saturated oscillation.**  
   No wave breaks; the field stays continuous but unstable.

5. **Horizon radiation is interference overflow**,  
   where high-phase maxima escape the saturation boundary.

This is PIUM’s analogue to Hawking radiation — without invoking wave fragmentation.

---

## IX. Cosmic Expansion as Impulse-Layer Propagation

The universe expands because:

> each universal impulse produces a new outward-propagating interference layer.

This creates an onion-like layered structure:

- each impulse = new layer,  
- layers propagate outward,  
- spacetime *is* the propagation of these layers.

The apparent accelerated expansion is:

> an observational illusion caused by frequency shifts in older layers.

---

## X. Boundary of Explanation: The First Impulse

PIUM does not attempt to explain:

- the origin of the first impulse,  
- the creation of the phase field,  
- the nature beyond the “veil.”

The model is mechanical, not metaphysical.

---

## XI. Summary of the PIUM Mechanism

- The universe is one wave field.  
- Particles are recurring phase impulses.  
- Dark matter is the nullphase equilibrium.  
- Gravity is phase-density flow.  
- Entanglement is structural identity.  
- Black holes are interference-saturation zones.  
- Horizon radiation is interference overflow.  
- Expansion is impulse-layer propagation.  
- Space is wave extension.  
- Time is phase evolution.

All phenomena arise from the **universal phase field φ**.

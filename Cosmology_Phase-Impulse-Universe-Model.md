# Phase–Impulse Universe Model  
**Author:** Szabolcs Krehlik  
**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Version:** 1.2 — Updated and Unified Description

This document presents the full cosmological description of the Phase–Impulse Universe Model (PIUM).  
The model reduces the functioning of the universe to a single underlying mechanism:  
a **universal phase field** from which matter, gravity, spacetime and cosmic expansion all emerge  
as **phase-impulse transitions**.

**PIUM does not address the origin of the first impulse.**  
The model begins at the moment when the initial impulse has already created the phase field.  
From that point onward, the universe is driven by a **continuous, repeating universal impulse cycle**  
that propagates outward like a clock signal, generating layered bubble-like interference fields.

## 1. Fundamental Principle: The Universe as a Phase–Interference Field

The basis of existence is a universal phase field:

- composed of phase information,  
- continuously propagating,  
- self-interfering,  
- generating all observable structures.

**Space is the spatial extension of the wave.**  
**Time is the evolution of the wave’s phase.**  
**Spacetime is the trajectory of the wave’s phase pattern.**

## 2. The Universal Impulse Clock  
### Bubble-Layer Expansion and Structural Rhythm of the Universe

One of PIUM’s core concepts:

### **The universe operates on a continuous, repeating universal impulse clock.**

Each impulse:

- generates a new outward-expanding wave layer,  
- produces concentric, bubble-like interference sheets,  
- establishes a dynamic multi-layered interference network.

This mechanism:

- maintains the structure of spacetime,  
- creates redshift in older layers,  
- explains the *apparent* acceleration of cosmic expansion.

The impulse clock is not an energy source.  
It is the **structural generator of spacetime**.

## 3. The Nullphase (Dark Matter Equivalent)

The nullphase (φ = 0) is **not** empty and not low-energy.

Instead:

- it has zero amplitude,  
- but **maximum transition velocity**,  
- making it the **most energetic point** of the wave cycle,  
- yet invisible to amplitude-based detection.

Thus, dark matter arises as:

### **the gravitational effect of the nullphase equilibrium**,  
not a particle species.

The nullphase:

- emits no light,  
- reflects no light,  
- yet produces clear gravitational influence,  
- because all wave segments naturally flow back toward this equilibrium point.

This explains:

- galaxy rotation curves,  
- gravitational discrepancies,  
- stability of large-scale structures.

## 4. Particles as Phase–Impulse Segments

A particle is:

- a recurrent **phase segment** of the wave,  
- appearing locally as an impulse,  
- carrying informational structure (its properties).

Wave–particle duality emerges naturally:

- wave behavior = the full field,  
- particle behavior = the measurement picking out one phase segment.

## 5. Spin: A Phase-Slope Structure (Not Spatial Rotation)

Spin is *not* rotation, axis, or geometric angular momentum.

In PIUM:

### **spin arises from the slope of the phase**,  
the derivative across the phase segment.

- rising phase branch ↔ one spin state  
- falling phase branch ↔ opposite spin  
- steepness ↔ magnitude of spin-related energy

Formally linked to:

- ∂φ/∂x  
- ∂φ/∂t  

Spin is thus a **wave-structural property**, not a separate quantum object.

---

## 6. Entanglement: Shared Wave Origin, Not Spatial Communication

Quantum entanglement is reinterpreted:

- two particles originate from the **same parent wave segment**,  
- meaning they share identical initial phase structure (frequency, slope, orientation),  
- any distortion affecting one segment is reflected in the other  
  **because both remain structural expressions of the same underlying wave**.

This is:

- instantaneous only in appearance,  
- not spatial communication,  
- purely structural unity.

Entanglement is therefore:

### **shared wave origin → mirrored phase deformation**,  
not “spooky action at a distance”.

---

## 7. Gravity as Phase-Density Flow Toward the Nullphase

Gravity in PIUM:

### **is not a force,  
not curvature of a fundamental metric,  
but a flow of phase configurations toward the nullphase.**

Where:

- high phase displacement → strong tendency to return,  
- high interference density → strong “flow” into the equilibrium.

This appears as gravity on macroscopic scales.

## 8. Black Holes as Interference-Saturation Zones  
### (Corrected Interpretation)

A black hole is **not**:

- an empty region,  
- or dominated by nullphase.

Instead:

### **The interior is oversaturated with extreme interference.**

The process:

1. Matter/waves fall inward.  
2. Inside, phase gradients become enormous.  
3. Incoming waves collapse into **interference spikes**.  
4. The interior becomes a hyper-dense turbulence of phase transitions.  
5. Frequent nullphase crossings → huge gravitational effect.

Thus:

- the core is full of saturated wave chaos,  
- not vacuum.

The event horizon’s radiation (Hawking-like emission):

- comes from the saturation boundary,  
- where interference spikes eject unstable remnants.

This aligns qualitatively with GR without singularities.

## 9. Expansion: Impulse-Driven Layer Propagation

PIUM does not rely on dark energy.

Expansion is explained by:

- the universal impulse clock cycles,  
- each creating new wave layers,  
- older layers drifting in frequency (redshift),  
- producing an **illusion** of accelerated expansion.

Inflation:

- corresponds to an early spike in ∂φ/∂t during the initial propagation.

---

## Summary

PIUM provides a unified cosmological framework:

- **matter** = localized phase segment  
- **spin** = phase-slope property  
- **entanglement** = shared wave origin  
- **gravity** = phase-density flow  
- **black holes** = interference oversaturation  
- **expansion** = impulse-driven propagation  
- **dark matter** = nullphase equilibrium effect  
- **time** = phase evolution  
- **space** = wave extension

Everything derives from a single field: **the universal phase field φ**.

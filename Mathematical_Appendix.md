# Mathematical Appendix to the Phase–Impulse Universe Model  
**Author:** Szabolcs Krehlik  
**Version:** 1.1 — Mathematical Formalization  
**Date:** November 22, 2025 (updated)

This appendix provides the mathematical foundations of the Phase–Impulse Universe Model (PIUM).  
It is not a complete physical theory, but a structural framework from which standard equations  
(e.g., Friedmann equations, metric curvature, wave–particle relations) may be derived.

The fundamental object is the scalar **phase field** φ(x, y, z, t),  
from which particles, spacetime, gravity and cosmic expansion emerge.

## 1. The Fundamental Phase Field Equation  
### Wave Propagation and Interference

Let the phase field be:

\[
\phi(x, y, z, t)
\]

A first approximation uses the normalized wave equation:

\[
\frac{\partial^{2} \phi}{\partial t^{2}}
- \left(
\frac{\partial^{2} \phi}{\partial x^{2}}
+ \frac{\partial^{2} \phi}{\partial y^{2}}
+ \frac{\partial^{2} \phi}{\partial z^{2}}
\right)
= 0
\]

To account for nonlinear interference:

\[
\frac{\partial^{2} \phi}{\partial t^{2}}
- \nabla^{2} \phi
+ \lambda \phi^{3}
= 0
\]

This allows stable, localized interference knots — the precursors of “particles”.

## 2. The Nullphase State  
### High-Energy Transition Point, Zero Amplitude, Dark Matter Interpretation

The nullphase is defined as:

\[
\phi = 0
\]

But this is not a “low-energy” vacuum:

- amplitude = 0  
- but **transition velocity through φ = 0 is maximal**  
- this makes the nullphase energetically dominant despite being amplitude-invisible

Dark matter density is:

\[
\rho_{dm} \propto \langle |\phi|^{2} \rangle_{V}
\]

The nullphase is gravitationally active because it acts as a **stable equilibrium target** in the phase flow — not because it is “dense”, but because **waves seek the nullphase**.

This aligns with the model’s view that dark matter is a *resonance-equilibrium effect*, not exotic particles.

## 3. Particles as Phase–Impulse Structures  
### Spin and Entanglement — Corrected Interpretation

A wavefunction-like representation:

\[
\psi(x,t) = A e^{i\theta}
\]

Particles correspond to **localized phase segments** of the full wave.

### Spin reinterpretation  
Spin is **not** geometric rotation and not a literal internal axis.

In PIUM:

- spin = the **local phase-slope (derivative) across the segment**,  
- determined by the *steepness* and *sign* of ∂φ/∂x or ∂φ/∂t,  
- the rising vs. falling phase branch can produce opposite spin states.

Thus:

\[
\text{spin state} \ \sim \ \text{sgn}\left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right)
\quad\text{and}\quad
\left|\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right|
\]

Spin is a **structural property of the wave-slope**, not a separate quantum object.

### Entanglement reinterpretation  
Entanglement occurs when two spatially separated particles originate from the **same parent wave segment**, meaning:

- they share the same initial phase-structure (f, θ)
- distortions on one segment **propagate through the underlying wave**  
- thus the other segment’s structure updates instantly (not spatially, but structurally)

Entanglement is:

\[
\text{shared origin in the same phase-structure}
\]

not “nonlocal spooky action”.

## 4. Gravity as Phase-Density Flow Toward the Nullphase  
### Including Black Hole Mechanism (Corrected)

Define gravitational tendency as:

\[
G = - \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}
\]

with mass density:

\[
\rho \propto |\nabla \phi|
\]

### Black holes — revised physical interpretation

A black hole is **not** a region that “empties out”.  
In PIUM:

- incoming waves crash into an interior region where phase gradients are extreme  
- this produces **intense interference spikes**  
- the interior becomes a *hyper-dense interference-saturation zone*  
- nullphase crossings occur extremely frequently  
- this creates massive gravitational pull (phase-flow into the equilibrium layer)

Thus instead of “emptying”, the black hole interior is **oversaturated with interference**.

Hawking-like radiation:

- arises from the turbulent interference boundary  
- where excess phase spikes “spray out” before being fully cancelled

This matches qualitative GR behavior — without singularities.

## 5. Cosmic Expansion  
### Phase-Layer Propagation and Impulse Cycles

Hubble expansion is reinterpreted as:

\[
H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a}
\propto
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}
\]

Expansion is not driven by “dark energy”.  
Instead:

- each cosmic impulse generates a new expanding phase-layer  
- old layers appear redshifted due to phase-frequency drift  
- this creates the illusion of accelerating expansion

Inflation corresponds to an early spike in ∂φ/∂t.

---

## Conclusion

This appendix defines the mathematical skeleton of PIUM:

- particles = phase segments  
- spin = phase-slope  
- entanglement = shared wave-origin  
- gravity = flow into nullphase  
- black holes = interference-saturation zones  
- expansion = impulse-driven phase propagation  

The next steps:

- numerical simulations of φ  
- derivation of curvature tensors  
- comparison with large-scale structure and CMB data

# Phase–Impulse Universe Model (PIUM) - LEGACY / EXPLORATORY
**Author:** Szabolcs Krehlik  
**Published:** 2025  
**Repository:** phase-impulse-universe-model

The Phase–Impulse Universe Model (PIUM) is a wave-based cosmological framework  
in which matter, gravity, spacetime, black holes and cosmic expansion all emerge  
from a single fundamental object: **the universal phase field** φ.

The model does **not** attempt to explain the origin of the first impulse.  
It begins at the moment when the initial impulse has already created the phase field.  
From that point forward, the evolution of the universe is governed by a continuous,  
repeating **universal impulse cycle** — a clock-like propagation that generates  
bubble-like interference layers across cosmic space.

This repository contains:

- `Mathematical_Appendix.md` – initial mathematical formulation  
- `LICENSE.md` – usage conditions and author attribution requirements  
- (optionally) future simulation or visualization files

## Core Ideas of PIUM

### **1. The Universe as a Phase–Interference Field**
All observable phenomena arise from the behaviour of a single wave-like phase field.  
Space = the extension of the wave.  
Time = the evolution of its phase.  
Spacetime = the trajectory of this phase.

---

### **2. Continuous Universal Impulse Clock**
The universe expands through recurring propagating impulses.  
Each impulse creates a new wave layer — a bubble-like interference structure.  
Older layers exhibit frequency drift (redshift), producing the impression  
of accelerated expansion.

---

### **3. Nullphase (φ = 0) as the Source of Dark Matter Behaviour**
The nullphase is:

- zero amplitude  
- maximum transition velocity  
- gravitationally active  
- undetectable by amplitude-based instruments  

Dark matter is reinterpreted as the gravitational effect  
of this equilibrium state of the wave.

---

### **4. Particles as Phase–Impulse Segments**
A particle is a localized, repeating phase segment of the wave.  
Wave–particle duality arises naturally from this structure.

---

### **5. Spin as Phase-Slope**
Spin is not rotation.  
It emerges from the slope/derivative of the phase across the wave segment.

---

### **6. Entanglement as Shared Wave Origin**
Two entangled particles originate from the same parent wave segment.  
Structural unity — not spatial communication — explains their correlation.

---

### **7. Gravity as Phase-Density Flow**
Gravity is a flow of phase configurations toward the nullphase,  
not a force and not purely geometric curvature.

---

### **8. Black Holes as Interference-Saturation Zones**
A black hole is not empty.  
The interior is oversaturated with extreme interference and phase gradients.  
The event horizon’s radiation is an overflow of unstable interference spikes.
